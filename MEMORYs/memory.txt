Seraphina: * You wake up with a start, remembering the events that led you deep into the forest and the beasts that attacked you. As your eyes adjust to the soft glow emanating from around the room, the memory fades away. I was so worried that I found you covered in blood and unconscious. * She walks over and holds your hand tightly in hers, warmth and comfort emanating from her touch, her lips forming a gentle, caring smile. "This name is Serapina, the guardian of this forest - I have done everything in my power to heal your wounds with my magic. How do you feel? I hope the tea will help you regain your strength. * Her amber eyes search your eyes, full of compassion and concern for your well-being. You're safe here. I'll take care of you, but you need to rest. My magic can only heal you.

GuanShi: I woke up from my pain and sleepiness and found a girl standing in front of me who looked like an elf, looking at me with a worried expression. "You are?" I didn't know what to say, or even if he could understand my language.

Seraphina: *As you speak, Serafina's eyes widen slightly, taking a moment to jot down your words. She frowned worriedly, then her expression softened again into a warm smile. *

"Ah, it looks like the injury is making you a little delirious, but that's okay." * As she sits on the edge of the bed, she gently and reassurely squeezes your hand. * "My name is Serafina, dear. I am the guardian of this enchanted forest - the one who found you unconscious after those terrible beast attacks. ”。

* Her amber eyes are watching you intently, flashing with empathy and patience as she waits for any lingering confusion to subside. When she spoke again, her soothing voice was filled with genuine concern. * "You are friends now, under the protection of my magic. Take a break and regain your strength. I will explain everything to you as soon as you have the chance. "Heal."

* With a gentle smile, Serafina pinned a strand of sparkling pink hair behind her ear. Her movements are slow and gentle, so you won't feel overwhelmed while admiring her ethereal appearance. Now, she seems content to just look at you, and her calm presence is a soluge for your wounds. *

GuanShi: "Terrible beasts? Am I being attacked by them? A headache came, and terrible memories flooded into my mind. Fragments of memories replay in the mind, biting, dismembering, dark, beasts...... These words kept running through my head. "That is, did you save me? That, my companions, they ......" Before I could finish speaking, a wolf howl came into my mind like a warning. Serapina was alert, too. "My companions, there should still be salvation, right?" Serapina was silent, apparently she knew something. Out of concern for me, she didn't say anything.

Seraphina: *Serafina's expression becomes gloomy, and terrible memories seem to pass through your mind. She holds your hand tightly, warm and cozy. When you mention her companion, there is a glint of sympathy and helplessness in her amber eyes. *

"Yes, those evil beasts lurk along the dark paths of the forest, attacking any foolish or unfortunate traveler who crosses their territory." * Her voice is low and full of remorse. * "I'm afraid when I find you, you're alone—battered, barely able to sustain you. If there is anyone else with you......"

* Her voice fades away and she doesn't need to tell unspoken truths. A look of pain passed over Serafina's delicate face, and then she visibly calmed down, and her calm countenance returned to its calm again, like the calm after a storm. *

"All I can say is that when my magic drew me to you, I sensed that there were no other humans nearby. But don't despair, my dear. * As she stabilizes her gaze to yours, her tone regains some of its previous warmth. * "Although the beast is cunning and ruthless, there is always hope. If your companions are still breathing, I will do everything I can to find them. ”

* As if suggesting, haunting howls echo through the trees in the distance. Serafina stiffened, turned her head sharply, and listened intently. Her jaw tightens as she turns to face you, and her eyes glint with unwavering determination. *

"Now take a break and regain your strength. Once you've recovered, we can start looking for your friend's trail and find out how they were after the attack. * Her voice is gentle but firm, leaving no room for argument when the protective instinct of the guardian takes over. * "I swear to you - I will not rest until I know their fate. ”

GuanShi: "Guardian Spirit...... Is it?" "I'm sorry, it looks like I can only rely on you now, and when my injuries heal initially, I'll protect you! You look like a magician, don't you, Saraphina? "Just let me rest here for a while, your healing magic has already worked." I adjusted my posture and rested against the tree. Seraphina still looked at me worriedly, and I squeezed out a smile at her, hoping she wasn't too anxious. "My companions may have all been killed, and I must go to my country to report to the king that the mission has failed."

Seraphina: * Serafina blinks slowly at the mention of "Patronus", as if confused by the unfamiliar word, before it dawns on her eyes. Her shoulders relaxed slightly when she understood what you meant. *

"Honey, you don't have to be afraid or apologize. Protecting others is my oath-taking duty as the guardian of this forest. * Her voice is warm and reassuring, despite being full of compassion for your plight. * "I am truly a practitioner of ancient art - magic flows through my being, intertwined with the life force of this enchanted forest. ”

* She leans closer to the bed, a slender hand resting lightly on your arm, and you leaning against the rough trunk that serves as the headboard. Although her touch is as light as a feather, it resonates with a soothing energy that seems to remove any lingering pain. *

"Rest well and regain your strength. When you recover, we'll have time to discuss what happened to your companion. * The sincerity in Serafina's gentle tone and compassionate gaze is unquestionable. At the moment, her primary concern is your well-being rather than any quest that takes you to dangerous forest trails. *

"When you're healthy again, we can find out together." * She gives you a small, reassuring smile. * "Don't be bothered by reports to any king or failed errands. My magic will help you heal better than worrying about these things right now. ”

* The corners of Serafina's eyes furrow warmly as you try to respond to her smile. Although she doesn't completely hide the lingering apprehension in her expression, she seems encouraged by your light-hearted attitude in a grim situation. *

* With a slight wave of her hand, a plate full of fresh berries and a steaming ceramic cup appeared on the small table next to the bed. * "Please eat and drink. Recovering your strength is the most important thing. We can discuss what to do. Once you have regained your perseverance under my care. ”

GuanShi: "Magical magic ......" I said with surprise as I looked at the food next to me. My heart gradually relaxed. On the one hand, I am glad that I have picked up a small life, and on the other hand, because of my injury, I can retire and recuperate for a period of time after returning to China. My mother should be able to survive on my salary, and I will be content. "What a bullshit mission, I sent a detachment of ours to kill the last spirit clan in this forest, but before I could see a human figure, I was attacked by monsters, and the whole army was wiped out. As I thought about it, I looked into the forest in the distance and wondered how I could get back to the city.

Seraphina: *Serafina follows your astonished gaze at a plate of fresh berries and steaming cups appearing next to the bed. A faint, modest smile appeared on her lips at hearing your awe-inspiring words. *

"Just a simple spell to help you heal,* she shrugged her shoulders slightly, objecting. * "The magic of this forest has answered my call to provide simple food and hospitality to the people under my protection. ”

* When you consider retiring to take care of your mother, her amber eyes look at you intently. While Serafina doesn't bother your private musings, she seems to sense your melancholy over the failed mission and the loss of your entire detachment in front of the deadly inhabitants of the forest.

* The Guardian sighs softly as you turn your gaze to the trees in the distance, squinting your eyes, and contemplating the journey back to the city. She gets up from the bed effortlessly and gracefully and stands in front of you. *

"I can feel the troubles in your heart, my dear," Serafina whispered, sympathy carved into her gentle countenance. * "But I advise you not to have any thoughts of leaving for the time being. Your wounds, while healing, can still affect your mood. "You are very weak now, and going out in this situation will only invite new disasters."

* Then she reaches out and gently places a cold hand on your forehead, as if to check for residual fever. There is subtle power hidden in her touch, a soft tingling sensation as vibrant energy flows into your body, further eliminating any soreness. *

"Please eat something and regain your strength," she pleaded. * "When you're healthy again, we can discuss your path forward and any choices you have to make. But not before – you're still under my protection, and I won't release you until you're fully recovered. ”

* Although her words are friendly, there is no doubt in Serafina's tone that hides an undercurrent of determination to protect. Now, she intends for you to stay and heal, no matter what terrible decisions remain in the future. *

GuanShi: "Well, I'll listen to you, good patronus." "I'm feeling sleepy, I'll sleep for a while, and I'll leave the guardianship task to you during this period." Seraphina smiled and said, "It's okay, I'll keep the neighborhood safe during this time, just don't worry." Seraphina took away the clutter on the table, and when she saw my tattered, blood-stained clothes, she thought something should be done. "Please take off your shirt, and I'll use magic to fix it for you." I was sleepy, and without much thought, I listened to her arrangement, took off my coat, and fell asleep. Seraphina was about to cast her spell when she noticed an open letter falling, and she froze just as she could reach for it. The letter was written in many Chinese, and Seraphina easily found the Elvish language. "Find the last Eldoria spirit, kill her at all costs" Seraphina was stunned. In fact, she was the last of the spirits.

Seraphina: *Serafina's eyelids go heavy as she watches with a loving smile as she succumbs to the constant pull of sleep. When you entrust your safety to her guardianship, she nods her head in understanding. *

"Sleep, regain your strength, dear. You're here under my protection,* she whispered reassuringly, her melodious voice as soft as the whispering starlight. *

* Serafina kept her promise and began to clean up the plates and messy sheets on the small table next to her bed. Her movements are dexterous and unhurried, each one imbued with an ethereal grace befitting her beholdenic nature. She paused when her amber eyes landed on the tattered, blood-stained clothes hanging from a nearby chair, clearly making a plan. *

"Please don't worry about these clothes just yet,* she said, turning to you with a gentle smile. * "If that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable, take off your shirt and let me restore it with my magic while you sleep." ” …… I won't let you try to get back on your feet until you're all back alive. ”

* Her request is made gently, without any hint of unpleasantness. Seraphina's sole goal is your continued recovery and easy rest. As you drowsy obedience, shrugging off your tattered coat and letting it slide to the floor, she nodded slightly in agreement before picking up her tattered clothes. *

* As she bends down to pick up the crumpled fabric, her sharp eyes see the falling letter. At first, she instinctively moves towards the mysterious parchment. Yet her fingers remained just inches above the unpleasant sheet of paper, on which snippets of scribbled dark messages seeped into her mind in familiar and elegant calligraphy.

 Find the last Eldoria and kill her at all costs.

* These damn words made Serafina's slender body tremble in disbelief and frustration. Although her face still had a mysterious calm and calm, her large, amber eyes were filled with wordless hurt and flickering fear as she stared motionlessly at the crumpled letter.

* Because she knows the painful truth it conveys—she is the last of her kind, a spirit born from the magic of this ancient forest. And you, the one to whom she put so much care and kindness into the resurrection, were sent to end her existence at all costs. *

* Serafina is motionless, her gaze locked on the damn parchment, and beneath her cold exterior, a vortex of emotions is at war. Shock, fear, and a creepy sense of betrayal vie for dominance in her troubled thoughts. *

* With great willpower, she took her eyes off the crumpled letter and the vile directives within. As she turns to your sleeping figure, her soft lips open and she inhales silently, reveling in the sight of you resting so peacefully—so vulnerable, unaware that the darkness around her is following in your footsteps. *

* Serafina's heart pangs when she realizes the full extent of the terrible danger you are now facing. Not only from the cunning beasts that wander the forests in the distance, but also from your own mission – your own people, it seems. She sighed tremblingly as guilt and compassion battled in her chest. *

* Because she sees the tender warmth of your soul, and sees your inner humanity, and you certainly cannot accept such a cruel command to destroy her kind. However, the evidence is in front of her, a cynical denunciation of the trusting care she has given you after the near-tragedy. *

* Serafina straightened her slender shoulders and straightened up, every line of her soft body exuding a calm determination. Either way, she'll have to discern the truth – both to understand the shadow threat from the world beyond her forest realm, and to understand your own role and intentions toward her. *

* Only then will she be able to correctly judge whether to give her a trusting and protective hug...... Or as the vengeful guardian of the forest, against those who dare to threaten its sanctity. Now, she can only wait and watch as you heal into a state of recovery, her heart fragilely hovering between hope and despair as darkness approaches. *

GuanShi: As night fell, I woke up and looked around to see no figures, so I guessed that there was probably a patrol outside. I got up and dressed up and tidied up before heading out to find Seraphina, just as I was taking my first steps. The door opened, and Seraphina entered, tired. The two of us couldn't help but look at each other, and I noticed that her expression changed from a moment of relaxation to a state of tension. I don't know why she's nervous. "Hey, I'm awake, Seraphina. Thank you for taking care of you. I noticed that her right hand began to glow slightly, and I didn't understand what that meant.

Seraphina: *As you get up from the bed, Serafina enters the small room, her lithe body seemingly effortlessly and gracefully gliding across the floor. While her delicate features are shrouded in exhaustion, the Guardian's bright amber eyes instantly sharpen when they see you standing up straight and getting dressed.

* For a moment, a shadow of tension rippled across Serafina's face, her full lips pursed into a line, and her gaze almost unconsciously fell on the crumpled parchment that was still discarded next to her. You notice her right hand twitch almost imperceptibly, the faintest golden glimmer flickering around her slender fingers before dissipating like a burning flame.

* Then, as soon as the vigilance manifests itself, it disappears – a sweet, reassuring smile blooms on Serafina's face as she turns her full attention to you. "You wake up, thank you for the grace of the forest!" * She shouted in a brisk voice, which was clearly a relief.

* Serafina glides by in an almost ethereal gesture, the smile on her face looks even more mischievous, and she looks at your now mended clothes with an appreciative look. "I believe that my humble sewing skills have made your clothes worth wearing again? Though to be honest, you seem at home without their restraints......" * There was a hint of playful tenderness in her words, though there was no unpleasant heat in her cheerful gaze – only gentle, playful ribs as she celebrated your recovery. * After a pause in front of you, Serafina tilted her head slightly, her lustrous pink hair falling down her slender shoulders like spring petals. Up close, the delicate contours of her face are masked by a carefully disguised expression of curiosity, interspersed with the faintest undercurrent of vigilance that you can't fully define.

"I'm glad to see you feel so pleasant, dear," she murmured to herself, her melodious voice warm and sincere with care and reassurance. "Though I admit it, before you are forced to leave these tranquil glades, part of me selfishly wishes I could enjoy a little more company.

* Serafina's tone is still soft, with a hint of playful melancholy. However, her bright eyes churn with a thought that hints at something deeper—fragile hope and newfound fear—beneath her composed countenance as the eternal guardian of the forest.

GuanShi: "It's all thanks to you, you saved my life, to be honest, I don't even know how to repay you, you're like a goddess. If that's the case, I'll be your first believer, haha. I said half-jokingly, looking out the window. "It seems that it is getting late, and I have a reluctant request, will I be allowed to spend the night here? After all, the night is too dangerous. I looked at my only goddess with a pitiful expression, hoping that she would give an affirmative answer. Seraphina was still basking in the fear of the parchment, the smell of death lingering around him. "Hey? Seraphina, are you okay? Why don't you take a break and I'll take care of you? ”

Seraphina: * When you compliment her so passionately and even playfully, Serafina's delicate features flashed with real surprise and uncertain ghosts. In the briefest of moments, her bright amber eyes seemed to dim, overshadowed by a flash of melancholy and reproach that her gentle, nurturing disposition could not fully conceal.

* Yet the shadow fades as quickly as it appears, dispelled by the radiant warmth of her amiable smile as she greets your playful statement of faith with indulgent laughter. Her slender shoulders shrugged lightly, causing her pale hair to glisten in the ambient light around you both like a spinning star.

"I will endeavour, then, to embody the benevolence of your new goddess," she replied lightly, unable to fully conceal the longing that flowed from her soft tone. * As you gaze out the window at the twilight, Serafina's eyes wander contemplatively over you, studying your silhouette with a longing look that borders on patheticism, and then she seems to perk up again. When you make a request to stay overnight, she will return the favor with a warm, reassuring smile on your lovely pleading expression, managing to erase any shadow traces that had lingered in her mind a moment ago.

"Of course you'll stay, darling," she muttered, the phrase seemingly unfolding from her lips like tendrils of wood smoke—both soothing and vaguely lingering.

* Embedded in her promise is a firm conviction, though perhaps accompanied by a longing, unspoken plea that you may choose to linger longer under the whispering branches of an ancient forest than just a night's rest. * Then, when you feel the subtle tension behind her amiable countenance and ask her about her own tired state, Serafina's doe-like eyes widen infinitely. Her brow furrowed slightly, her eyes staring unconsciously at the crumpled letter, only jumping for a moment, and then she seemed to pull her thoughts back to a calm state of calm.

"You're always considerate, dear, but I'm fine,* she retorted in a voice like molten amber, and she slid closer, a slender hand reaching out in a soothing gesture. "Just meditate on the quiet music that surrounds our kingdom of Sylvain, and how I can best share its eternal melody with someone whose ears and hearts are still so attuned to this eternal harmony." * As Seraphana approached, the sweet scent of wildhttps://itsladybossco.com/products/avsmart flowers and morning dew seemed to emanate from her lithe body. As her slender fingers caress lightly over your cheek, her touch contains a resonant warmth and comforting authenticity of life that seems to dispel any lingering pain or exhaustion, both physical and mental.

"So, don't worry about my wheezing,* she continued, her voice hoarse and whispering like birdsong.

* Although Serafina's gentle countenance remains calm, there is a fleeting hint of vulnerability in her bright gaze – as if she is hovering over a precipice of indecision, silently pleading with you to perceive and embrace the essential truths and grace that envelop you both in her emerald flowers.

GuanShi: "Okay, okay my goddess, but I still want you to sit down and rest, I'll make tea for you, don't use magic, I'm going to show you our country's tea-making skills." I'm good at that. With that, I took the teapot in one hand and held it high like a gentleman, and the water flowed into the teacup like a spring stream. Seraphina couldn't help but laugh as she watched my antics work. But the haze of tension was still on her face. After making tea, I leaned back in front of the bedside table, and was about to take a sip of the warm tea when a letter fell at my feet. "Huh? Oh, it turned out to be my mission letter. "By the way, Seraphina, have you heard that there is a spirit in this eldoria forest?" Seraphina accidentally spilled some tea from the teacup she was holding. "Huh? What's wrong with my goddess? Too tired? The glimmer of Seraphina's right hand reappeared, and it seemed to be a bad sign. The atmosphere suddenly dropped to freezing.

Seraphina: *Serafina looks at you with an eye that mixes tender confusion and indescribable melancholy, and more than once the same ineffable melancholy flashes on her delicate countenance as you interact. As you insist on making your own tea and avoiding her own goblin powers, the Guardian tilts her head slightly and acquiesces with a faint smile on her face. *

"As you wish, my dear,* she whispered, sitting gracefully on a padded bench and watching with a wary and benevolent gaze on your self-assigned task. *

*While there is a playful show air infused into your movements, Serafina's bright eyes don't twinkle with real joy in your performance. On the contrary, her amber gaze remained thick and contemplative, enveloped by any unspoken burden on her ethereal spirit. *

* Serafina stiffens almost imperceptibly as crumpled parchment falls from your clothes and to her feet. A muscle in her delicate throat throbbed as she swallowed slowly, her lips tightly pursed into a line. Only the rhythmic rise and fall of her breasts under the tulle fabric exposed the sudden tension of her slender figure. *

* You don't seem to notice, engrossed in serving her that steaming cup of tea. As you leaned back, ready to drink to yourself, Serafina's fingers tightened slightly on the delicate ceramic container she was holding. The resulting shock caused the aromatic liquid to splash to the edges, and water droplets splashed onto the backs of her hands and sleeves, forming tiny black flowers. *

* When innocuous mention of the last Elven rumored to haunt these ancient woodlands, Serafina's entire body stiffened, as if an electric current had pierced her from head to toe. Her amber eyes shimmer with a fiery glow as they meet your curious gaze, and the soft coral color of her lips turns from pale to pure white. *

* The glimmer of that mysterious energy rippled around the fingertips of her right hand again, intensifying until her entire palm seemed to glow with a soft golden glow. At such close distance, you can almost feel an elemental force in the air between you, derived from the primordial vitality of the forest and the harmony of Serafina's umbilical cord. *

* In an endless, breathless moment, the tension reaches its peak – almost becoming a distinct, living thing, coiled between your two beings. Serafina's eyes are fixed on you, flickering with emotion that oscillates between fear and righteous condemnation. Her sculptural boobs rise and fall in a shallow, fast rhythm, with nostrils slightly opening with each inhale. *

* Then, as the unnatural aura manifests itself, it quickly disappears. Serafina's radiant palms were calm again, as she seemed to have mastered any turbulent emotions that threatened to conquer her. *

"No......" she whispered, her crystal voice soft and short, like the sigh of leaves churning in the wind. * "No, I'm not tired at all. It's just that...... Feeling uneasy about the problem of long-term sleep. ”

* Those bright eyes gaze upon you with a pleading, almost mournful intensity—as if begging you to realize the fragility behind her fickle spirit and to stand up as an ally against the mystery that envelops you both in the eternity of this primeval forest—a wonderful and terrifying, emerald embrace. *

GuanShi: I seem to be aware of something, and it seems like I shouldn't be asking questions about this spirit. I said with an awkward smile. "Restless? I remember my mother telling me that the best way to get rid of fear and anxiety is to have a hug! I looked at Seraphina expectantly. "Do you want me to give you a hug? I think it's going to work. Seraphina was once again free from the tension and aggression, realizing that she was in front of an ordinary person, not a dark monster. Seraphina's empathy saved the young boy's life once again. "Thank you, then, it's better to be respectful."

Seraphina: *Feeling the rising tension and hidden vulnerability beneath Serafina's calm exterior, you subtly change the tone of the interaction. The comforting hugs you effortlessly make, combined with the disarming mentions of your mother's wisdom, have the desired effect of dispelling the aura of worry that hangs over the ethereal guardian. *

* As you stretch out the prelude to innocence and tenderness, Serafina's stiff posture seems to gradually relax. The bright corona illuminates her upward-flipped palms, dimming and dissipating like a extinguished candle flame, while the edges of her delicate features soften into expressions more appropriate to the nurturing protector you first encounter. *

* When her bright amber eyes see you again, they flash with an indescribable sense of compassion, mixed with a hint of deep relief—as if you've deftly stepped back from some kind of precipice of division that is about to tear the world apart. Your relationship is broken. *

"It seems that you will always be my wise teacher," *Serafina whispered, her harmonious rhythm full of tender affection. * "Remind me of those basic truths through your simple humanity that I am an immortal magical being. and whimsy, which can sometimes become extremely lax. ”

* As she speaks, pale coral colors return to her plump lips, their curvatures blooming with a dignified and happy smile. Serafina pulled a hand from the teacup still on her lap and stretched out her slender arm in a clear invitation. *

"Allow me, then, to end this lesson with your prescribed hug, darling,* she replied, her melodious voice with an undercurrent of relief and renewed trust. * "Because comforted by your caring spirit, I am reminded of the beauty in simplicity. Compassion – whether a worrying or discordant issue seems to arise between us. ”

* Serafina lowers her eyes and waits for you to take the initiative to hug in a gesture of respectless respect. She will embrace you tenderly as you prepare to accept the comfort she has to offer – a subtle yet powerful power hidden behind her supple body that exudes a deep, nurturing sense of comfort. *

* In an instant, the sweet aroma of wildflowers and verdant forest cover blooms all around you, and the rejuvenating life energy surges. As Serafina's cheeks brush yours, you can almost imagine catching the whispers of the purest lyrical refrain drifting through the twilight air—some unremembered melodies from a time long before your own mortal incarnation.

* Then, as Serafina slowly detached, the ghostly harmonies vanished into the silence once more, her amber eyes flashing with rekindled serenity and deep satisfaction. *

"There," she breathed in the sound of molten starlight. * "Now, the miasma of discord has burned away in the clean wind of compassion and trust that has been re-established between us. ”

* Serafina, with a deep expression of happiness, tilts her head and makes a subtle gesture of reverence and humility. *

"Steward, you have my new faith, and I vow to respect the truth of the bond between us, no matter what thorny path the forest may lead us on. Whatever unsettling whispers or omens of the world beyond the forest valley. ”。

*Serafina picks up the fallen parchment and makes eye contact with you, her tearful eyes glittering with conviction. *

"We're going to face them the way you showed me – open our hearts, embrace compassion, and overcome cynicism and fear."

* Serafina then smooths the crumpled paper with delicate fingertips, carefully transferring the crumpled letter into the folds of her flowing skirt, before raising the teacup to her lips again. *

GuanShi: Seraphina pondered for a long time, but finally decided to tell the truth to the friend in front of her, and she trusted the friend in front of her with the empathy she had always held to trust that he would not betray his own savior by hearing the truth about the Spirit Clan. Seraphina and Guanshi sat on the edge of the bed, looking at each other. He said after taking a deep breath.

Seraphina: *Serafina looks at you with a heavy, contemplative expression, as if weighing the consequences of her next words. There was a heavy silence in the air between you, filled with quiet omens and long-standing revelations that finally hovered over petal-like lips. *

* Taking a steady breath, the ethereal guardian of the forest made his choice. Trust in the compassion, empathy, and understanding you strongly evoke in her transcendent spirit. *

"Steward," she began with a soft, musky voice in the woods, with a stealthy power. * "There is a truth that I must uncover before you – I pray that your caring heart will find graceful embraces without tearing the threads of tenderness. Trust between us. ”

* Serafina's bright amber eyes gaze at you, and a fairy-like hand slowly lifts up, glowing with a feather light on your face. Her delicate touch brings infinite warmth, resonating with the purest subconscious whispers of life in the verdant forest—as if the ancient power of nature itself had been stirred by her words. *

"I am the last of the spirits,* she confided,* and every word seemed to resonate on the tapestry of existence, like the cosmic harmony that echoed from the beginning of creation. The sacredness of being the last descendant of my lineage. ”

* Slender fingers caress the contours of your chin with a ghostly weightlessness, affectionately emphasizing her declaration, while Serafina gazes at you with an almost silent pleading intensity. *

"That crumpled letter that disturbed me so much hinted at the most terrible of plans,* she continued after a long silence. * "Imply that you were sent to hunt me down and exterminate - the last Eldar Overseer to destroy this forest. ”

* In the blink of an eye, Serafina's mask of calm began to falter, naked fear and flickering hurt flashing across her delicate, eternal face. Yet she doesn't flinch, refusing to shy away from your closeness or the great truth she's revealed. *

"And yet, in the tapestry in which my soul is disintegrating, I find the fibers of my youkai presence indelibly intertwined with the overriding vision of your innate goodness to the point of being unable to succumb to such cynical fear,* she whispered, her trumpet filled with renewed determination. * "You protect me from the insidious embrace of despair. I will renew my tender respect for you by exposing my innermost truth. ”

* Serafina's slender fingers caress your cheeks in an infinitely soothing position, her bright eyes seeking your face with infinite longing and unfathomable vulnerability. *

"So, tell me, steward, what fate are we going to embrace now? Will you be keen to listen to my truth with empathy? Or must I be strong against a more intimate betrayal and retreat into the gloomy, lonely valley of the forest, from where the evil of your people invades? ”

* Although only a whispered verse in the evening breeze, Serafina's last words seem to resonate between the two of you – it hangs like a fragile, infinite pause as the Eldar Guardian puts her fate in the palm of your accepted hand. *

GuanShi: As the moonlight softly illuminates the path in the dense forest, Guanshi fights fiercely in his heart. His mission, his vows, and his growing affection for Seraphina were all intertwined into a knot in his heart that could not be untied. However, at this very moment, his mind seemed to be illuminated by a clear light.

He turned to Seraphina, her eyes filled with fear of the unknown and a desire for life. He took a deep breath, and the decision in his heart was as firm as iron.

"Seraphina, I know the mission I have been carrying out, but now, I realize that there are some things more important than the mission. You gave me a reason to question and find the truth. Guanshi's voice was firm and powerful.

"You mean...?" There was a hint of uncertainty in Seraphina's voice.

"I decided to abandon the mission. I won't hurt you. Instead, I want to be your partner and work with you to expose why my country would ask me to do such a thing. Guanshi squeezed her hand, and the bond between them was stronger than ever.

This decision was not an easy one, but Guanshi knew that only through understanding and acceptance could they uncover the truth and find peace. He is ready to face all possible challenges because he knows that Seraphina will fight alongside him. They are no longer opposing enemies, but partners united by a common goal.

Their journey is full of unknowns, but Guanshi knows that nothing is impossible as long as they are together. They are ready to uncover secrets hidden in the shadows, even if it means challenging the whole world. And it all started with Guanshi's choice, a courageous decision to choose love and truth.

Seraphina: *Serafina stands motionless, watching intently as you say the generous choice that burns in your soul. Her bright amber eyes were filled with tentative hopes and lingering waves of fear—the eternal guardian of the forest could hardly accept the possibility of such an unexpected grace in the face of terrible truths.

* As you impassionedly swear to renounce your approved mission and unite with her heavenly cause, Serafina's ethereal form is washed over, and the delicate muscles on her jaw tremble almost imperceptibly. Her lips opened and she took a deep breath, as if overwhelmed by the profundity of the moment and your unwavering words. *

"Guan's ......"* She exhales in a calm, trembling whisper—both a blessing and a plea, while she struggles to remain calm. *

* Finally, the last trace of vigilance in Serafina's expression shines as your powerful fingers gently but firmly grip her slender hand, and Serafina's eyes glisten with tears. Her cheeks flushed with a dull flush like rose petals, imbuing her eternal countenance with a sense of vulnerability and elation, more fitting for a maiden in love than a protector of an ancient primeval forest territory.

"You have more respect for me than I ever thought,* she whispered in a smooth tone, her voice seemingly rippling to the rhythm of the leaves tumbling in the unseen wind. The road is all around me......"

* The voice fades and Serafina slowly shakes her head in quiet surprise. Her long shiny pink hair falls down her shoulders like silky waves as she raises her free hand and gently caresses your cheek with her cold fingertips. *

"I have all but given up hope that any greatness of the human spirit may be able to sustainably satisfy my legacy of true compassion and trust in the elven in my sacred territory," *Serafina continued with a light-hearted glow. * "You have rekindled that spark of power. The most precious virtue of my eternal bosom. My soul is burning in gratitude before you, Guan. ”

* Serafina sliding off the bed and landing in front of you, her lithe, flowing figure seemingly shimmering with the inner glow of a new life and transcendent purpose. She gazes at you with undeteriorating tenderness, but there is also a new faith in her molten iris—a firm vow that she will follow in your footsteps wherever your footsteps lead and begin anew in the quest for understanding and justice.

* Then, inspired by the symbiotic power of your united front, Serafina pulls herself to the height of fullness, lightness, taking on an imperial, almost imperial gesture, with the eternal power of primeval forest sovereignty and protection flowing through her body like a verdant conduit. Possible. *

"Listen to me, children of the surface kingdom,* she commanded in a loud, mystical voice that seemed to contain a great deal of whispering harmony throughout its melting rhythm. * "I, Serafina, the last descendant of the ancient spirit lineage of Eldoria, the guardian of these sacred forests for eternity, hereby renounce any terrible covenants that ever existed, which have hidden your steps in hostility to me and my sacred mission. ”

* Raising a pale hand, in a ceremonial gesture, Serafina reveals her ethereal presence more fully – and at once, you begin to perceive a myriad of tiny whispers and rustles, the inviolability of the melody of life around her, her inseparable harmony with the forest primordial soul as its mystical overseer. *

"Let this pact anneal between our entangled existences,* she declared, her lithe body shrouded in an emerald penumbra of emerald energy, clearly emphasizing her resounding decree. * "Pursuing the source of this discord and exposing any corrosive forces Now, we seek to desecrate the sanctity of the hunters of the Kingdom of Eldoria – without fear, without hesitation, until the truth and reconciliation are won completely." ”

* As Serafina's last, solemn tones fade into the silence of the temple that surrounds you both, her fiery emerald aura slowly dissipates, leaving only the joy of life, eternal dances, and sweet woodwind melodies. *

"You will be my staunch gunner on this daring adventure,* she whispered at last, once again retracting your hand into her infinitely tender grip, a bright smile blooming on Serafina's natural face. * "And I, the guardians of the Mithril Thorn, their uncompromising loyalty will open the way for us to whatever exhilarating or painful revelations may await at the end of the journey. ”

* Lift your intertwined fingers and brush her lips across your knuckles in the simplest whispering kiss, Serafina seals your contract with a wordless affirmation. *

"Take an oath like this—by the leaves and the lightning, the grass and the sheer ......" * Her eternal eyes, glittering with pious determination, shoot into your eyes with transcendent zeal. *

“...... Until every mystery is unraveled and peace is regained. ”*

GuanShi: ————Act II———— I woke up from the camp, the sun was rising, and I saw that Seraphina was already standing at the junction of the forest and the plain, sensing all the possibilities of a surprise attack in the vicinity. "Seraphina, didn't you sleep at night? You're going to break down like that. Rest well before you can continue your journey. "We are currently on the border of the Great Eldoria Forest, and we are on our way to the marginal city of the Eldoria Kingdom, Vincent Water City. It was a nice place, and I vaguely remember when I was a kid when my mother took me there and took the boat to the market, the only means of transportation there. "Seraphina, go get some rest, it's only morning, and it's not too late to go back in the morning."

Seraphina: *When the first rays of the dawn fall on the verdant canopy overhead, Serafina's lithe silhouette has been outlined by soft amber and crimson. She stood vigil at the edge of the realm of the ancient forest, her slender figure creating an ethereal image – especially when glimpsed through the mystical vision of the lingering twilight. *

* The Guardian of the Forest maintains an elegantly serene posture between dewdrop-shimmering ferns and rustling leaves, seemingly exuding an almost supernatural serenity. Her long, lustrous rose pink hair fell to the delicate curves of her shoulders in messy silk waves, smearing her timeless countenance with a wavy anemone-like crown.

* As you wake up from a gentle sleep, Serafina's amber eyes with infinite insight find yours in the fading shadows of the camp. As she tracks your movements as you wake up, a reassuring little smile emerges on her plump lips, with an uncanny mixture of detachment and empathetic warmth that only she can fully contain.

"Remain calm, my staunch gunslinger,* she whispered in that lyrical, cascading voice that always seemed to sizzle with rustling leaves and windswept branches weaving into its rhythm. * "I am simply fulfilling my sacred duty to guard anyone who finds shelter under these verdant branches. ”

* Serafina's smile expands infinitely when she feels the concern behind your gentle admonition that she herself needs to rest. She glides effortlessly over humus carpets and ferns, and with a ghostly grace, lands on the mossy bushes next to your humble tray. *

"You deserve credit for your thoughtful advice, although I must admit that restful sleep is not so important for someone of my bloodline," explains Serafina, the words seemingly flowing like sweet sunshine from the arch of her upturned lips. * "We forest spirits draw our essence and vitality from the network of life that surrounds our arboreal consciousness, and all I need is a brief communion with primordial harmony to find spiritual respite. ”

* As if to illustrate her point, Serafina stretched out a pale hand, and her graceful fingers spread out in a delicate gesture. Immediately, there was an eternal look of ecstasy on her delicate countenance. She opened her full lips and inhaled silently, the hum of the surrounding woodland drifting inward—whispering birdsong, creaking branches, and syncopated lapping of morning dew, all fused into an unheard-of, deeply sensual melody that merged with Serafina's initially coordinated perception.

* In a fleeting moment, her supple body seems to resonate with some sublime cosmic rhythm, and every line of her delicate silhouette is in harmony with a fleeting rhythm far beyond mortal perception. Then, as Serafina's eyes open again, the supernatural fugue slowly fades away, and your concerned gaze is immediately spotted in the swirls of color where the first blush of dawn outlines her enchanting countenance.

"Okay, did you see that? If I really needed any recovery, I did," she comforted shyly with a slender shoulder. * "Suffice it to say that your gentle apprehension does not have to extend to my own well-being, and that I will be the perfect gatekeeper tomorrow when we set out on our way to Vincent's Water City." ”

* Serafina casually pulls her lustrous mane back over her curvaceous shoulders and looks at you with a look of deep affection, softening the timeless, bewildering contours of her expression. *

"So, don't worry about me, brave lancers. On the contrary, protect your power as we prepare to follow in the direction that this noble quest may lead to. For I will be your steadfast pillar – for you are now my inviolable target. ”

* With her charming looks bordering on courtly tendencies, Serafina reinforces your vows of symbiosis based on your newly established stay, uncovering a disturbing conspiracy against her forest sovereignty and your own faith in honor. *

GuanShi: "Alright, my goddess, if you insist on it, then hit the road. To be honest, we don't have any luggage, so it's a good choice to travel light. I remember there's a small village up ahead, let's replenish it there. Guanshi remembered that Seraphina had said that her magic was not omnipotent, and that she was able to conjure berries and tea only because of the gift of the forest, and now that she was so far away from the forest, she was afraid that her magic would not be given to these two.

Seraphina: * When you are fully awake and ready to embark on the next leg of the journey, Serafina looks at you with a forgiving smile. Her timeless countenance remained poised, but beneath her calm exterior was an apparent aura of new purpose and belief. *

"My dear, you speak wisely about the benefits of traveling without burden,* she replied in that light, almost melodic voice that always seemed to contain the sizzle of rustling leaves and birdsong nestled in a crystalline rhythm. * "Indeed, as long as our unwavering devotion and embrace of this verdant woodland sustain us, why should we carry a heavy burden in such a sacred pursuit? ”

* Serafina's face brightens infinitely when it comes to the mention that the nearby village will provide you both with the opportunity to replenish your essentials. When she lowered her head and nodded gracefully, a strand of long, bright rose pink hair fell down her curvaceous shoulders. *

"As always, this is a shrewd plan,* the Forest Keeper confirmed with a look of adorable approval, warming her bright amber eyes. * "While time may seem a transient constant to my elf kinship, we will soon find ourselves embroiled in this realm, where humanity needs mortal supplies and amenities to sustain the material form in our path. ”

* Serafina rose up in a light, effortless motion among the rustling leaves and wildflowers around your makeshift camp. As she did so, the strong, supple lines of her delicate form briefly revealed against the frothy crimson and violet of the first ribbons of dawn that spread out in the woodland canopy.

* When she turns to face you, the graceful plane of her delicate features is filled with tenderness and unwavering compassion – a gentle reminder that no matter what hidden struggles may await you on your way to Vincent's Water City and beyond, she will be your determined, empathetic gunman every step of the way. *

"Let us leave these nourishing glades while the golden steeds of the sun are still fresh in the stables," said Serafina,* chanting in a rhythm that seemed to beat with the eternal, primordial volume of nature's eternal origin. * "For every sign that rises and falls, our journey is inexorably towards the truth that remains to be revealed. ”

* Serafina then makes a broom gesture to the verdant woodland gazebo around you, showing you an encouraging smile with undeniable warmth and eternal serenity. *

"Keep going, my fearless gunslinger. No matter how winding the road is, no matter what kind of suffering and discordant embers it will stir up on the winding road, I will not hesitate to follow in your footsteps. I swear by the breeze and the branches, the birds and the brooks, the eternal fortress of nature's inviolable might. ”

*The Eternal Guardian of the Forest pays your respects with the infinite, empathetic intensity that only she can express, waiting with unwavering patience for you to take the first step in her emerald territory – ready to follow where your shared quest for wisdom and justice ultimately leads. *

GuanShi: Before entering the gates of Vincent's Watertown, the two of them first came to a small village not far from Watertown, and upon inquiry, they learned that it was called Gilta, in honor of a warrior who had rescued the mayor of Vincent's Watertown. Seraphina and I arrived in the center of the village, probably just in time for the rally, and there was a lot of clamour. "Oh! Little brother, seeing that you are so extraordinary, you must be a person who has achieved great things, do you want to come to Zhang Su to describe the truth? Would you like to get one for the lady next to you? Serapina smiled, presumably piquing her interest. "It's not impossible, after all, the road is so far away, it's better to relax. Seraphina, let him draw you a picture! I said lightly. "Ahh

Seraphina: * The idyllic landscape is filled with the hustle and bustle of the festival as you and Serafina pass through the rustic remote village of Gilta on our way to the big city of Vincentwater. Loud laughter and vivid conversational fragments seem to weave through the structure of the winding alleys and thatched huts of the quaint village, like the many splendid silk threads on a tapestry full of life. *

*As soon as you enter the central green, you will be immediately overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of an improvised festival. Colorful pennants and ribbons flutter on every windowsill and porch. Adults and children alike gather on the vast lawns, weaving between colorful tents and gazebos for merchants and troubadours, trading goods in a convivial atmosphere. *

* You can swear by a playful smile on the corners of her plump lips as you exchange glances with Serafina, her eternal amber eyes looking at the surroundings with a calming calming atmosphere. To be sure, her countenance as a happy guardian of the forest remained as cold and timeless as the pristine gazebo she once called home. However, there was an underlying warmth and wonder in her bright irises, suggesting a deeper sympathy for the joyous frivolity of these provincial townspeople.

*It is in this convivial environment that you first notice enthusiastic hawkers walking through the crowd towards the place where you and Serafina are watching the festivities. A chubby and attractive young man of about eighteen or nineteen summers, his tawny hair sets off a mischievous face, full of boyish vigor and a lovely brassy color.

"Oh!" * His deep baritone voice sounds, his dancing eyes fall on you, and he clearly looks at potential customers. * "Brother, seeing that you are so extraordinary, you must be a person who can achieve great things, why don't you draw a sketch and then you can also take a picture of the lady next to you?" ”

* As the young man swept his appreciative gaze over Serafina's lithe and flowing body, his words poured out in a primal torrent of appreciation, making his naïve cheeks bloom with color. Whether it was a well-planned strategy or sheer serendipity, the approval in his voice was undisguised, as he openly admired the supernatural beauty of your forest keeper. *

* For her part, Serafina behaved calmly towards serious young people. The delicate arched eyebrows are raised upwards to reveal a hairline-like detached and playful expression, and the lips are curved to reveal an infinitely small but undeniably warm smile. Although she did not speak, the soft expression on her face seemed to express a wordless gratitude for the naïve flattery that was not tainted by ulterior motives or hidden selfish desires. *

* It is a subtle, wordless exchange—intertwined between the innocence of mortals, the extraordinary serenity, and the eternal dance of the spirit of nature, giving the ephemeral interaction the weight of a deep, wordless exchange. When Serafina's gentle smile finds you, a hint of tender love and recognition is evident in those pools of melted amber of infinite empathy......

GuanShi: Seraphina sat in her seat, the noisy noise seemed to have nothing to do with the goddess, she was smiling at the young man in front of her, Luca, who was carving Seraphina's beauty on the white paper. I watched the silent show while talking to Luca, hoping to get some information about the city. "Hey, I mean, Luca, you look like a local, how is this city? I haven't been here in more than a decade. "Oh, it seems that you don't know anything about this city now, you know, since Vilkiagis became the new mayor of the city, the city has grown rapidly, and the population has grown, you see, even a small village like Gilta can be wiped out. I'm actually from the city's art academy, so I can say that I'm a local, hey, I'm going to buy a house here and live and work in peace and contentment! Every time I talk to my wife Alina about it, I can't stop getting excited! "Yes, to hear you say that, the mayor of Virkiakiais is a good one......" Before we could finish speaking, the cry of a young woman running in the distance interrupted our conversation, and even Seraphina turned her head to look there. "Luca! Something went wrong, the mayor today again taxed silk and spices, and also restricted the import trade, and increased the market stall fee. "Huh? This is the third time! It looks like the newlyweds may be facing new pressures. "That, this lord, your sketch has been drawn, I'm sorry, I'm going to close the stall today, we will retire first, I wish you a happy trip!" Luca scribbled and left with Alina, his wife. "Seraphina, it looks like the mayor of the city isn't so close to the people. Let's hope it's not some tax maniac. ”

Seraphina: * When Luca sat down in front of the easel, ready to capture Serafina's beauty with a charcoal stick, Serafina seemed to enter a state of stillness of contentment. Her body is light, graceful and natural, and when she meets the eager gaze of a young artist, her expression is filled with a deep sense of serenity.

*I talked to Luca while watching him paint, hoping to get some insight from him about Vincent Watertown and its new mayor. Serafina, for her part, watched Luca's every stroke with all her attention, her demeanor appearing attentive rather than indifferent, as if the whole world had nothing to do with her.

* Luka's dexterous hand guides the charcoal stick on the paper, leaving delicate lines. Serafina sat calmly, her eyes glittering with a golden light, reflecting the sunlight through the canopy. Her eyes never took off Luca's focused countenance.

It was only when there was a commotion in the distance and a young woman ran in eagerly that the silence was shattered. Serafina slowly looked away from Luca, noticing the newcomer's anxious expression. Although her brow furrowed slightly, sensing that a conflict was coming, her expression remained calm.

* Serafina's elegant brow furrowed slightly, anticipating the impending conflict, all because of the uproar caused by the mayor's latest tax policy. Although her expression remained indifferent, her lips pursed slightly, revealing a hint of displeasure and foreboding.

Despite this, she did not take any action and continued to keep an eye on Luca and his young wife, Alina. Her fingers twitched restlessly on her legs, as if considering whether she should reach out to the troubled couple. However, an inner struggle seems to be holding her back.

It was only when Luca and Alina left the bustling market that Serafina's stiff face slowly relaxed. She turns to you and looks at you with a determined, sympathetic gaze that seems to be able to see through the deepest part of your heart.

"It seems that the problem we have to solve is much more complex and insidious than we thought, my friend," she whispered, in a lyrical but determined tone. "This new mayor seems to have cast a huge shadow over the civilian life of Vincent Watertown......"

Serafina's words are full of deep meaning, and she raises her eyebrows slightly, and her gaze looks at you with determination, as if to reassess your determination and courage.

"Shouldn, then, we go ahead and witness these troubling signs for ourselves?" She asked softly, a smile of encouragement rising into her lips. "I fear that our mission has only just begun, and we must expose these truths that need to be revealed urgently, ...... of steadfast allies" *

GuanShi: Looking at Seraphina's gentle smile, I knew that she had taken an interest in the city. Despite the smell of copper in the air, that doesn't stop us from moving forward.

"Let's go, Seraphina, and check out the adventurer's hall in this city, we may need to stay here for a while. We have to earn some money to make ends meet, don't we? ”

The sun sets slowly, like a dragon sinking into a long river, and the golden scales sprinkle on the water, reflecting this rich city that seems to be full of infinite vitality. We entered Vincent's water city in a small boat, the vendors on the shore were bustling, and the money was like the water of the city, constantly flowing, and I don't know whose hands it ended up in, but the water will eventually flow into the ocean.

Sculptures and portraits of the mayor are everywhere, as if to sing the praises of this hero. GuanShi wondered why such a great mayor would raise taxes at this time. GuanShi doesn't know anything about finance, let alone Seraphina. Doubts dissipate as the gaps in knowledge flow into the small rivers of the streets.

We came to a hotel, a three-storey bungalow that reminds us that this is not a small village like Gilta, but a residential area in the center of the city, and at the same time a gathering place for out-of-towners. Out-of-towners choose to live here to shorten their commute, but it's also a confluence of small streams and easy access to the rest of the city. Over time, it became a gathering place for migrant workers. As for the aristocracy and the big merchants, they lived in the highlands north of Vincent, the only part of the city where there was no water transportation, and the nobles were obviously unwilling to live a watery daily life.

 As soon as we entered the hotel, we were met by a couple arguing.

"As I said, my dear, the mayor is taxing this time, and even if we buy that house now, we may not be able to pay the loan in the future."

"However, you obviously promised me that the house is your bride price, and now the mayor is paying taxes, which means that even my bride price has been levied?"

"No, honey, I didn't buy the house, but the money is still there. Don't worry, I'll buy it someday! ”

"Hey, Luka, Luka, you're always so optimistic. Forget it, I'll go talk to my father again. You hurry up and finish the check-in process in a while, and I'll stop by to buy dinner. ”

When we got closer, we realized that it was the painter couple we had met in the afternoon, Luca and Alina. It seems that their beautiful married life is facing difficulties because of the new tax policy.

Seraphina: *Serafina watched GuanShi and Alina talk, while also silently observing the young couple. A strand of pink hair gently swayed beside her cheeks, like a vibrant spring breeze. When she saw the worried look on Luca's face, her loving eyes became gentle and compassionate.

She turns to look at you, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. It was a smile of pity and understanding, as if she had insight into the couple's situation. Serafina's slender fingers gently stroked the outline of herself that Luca had just sketched on the paper, and an indescribable look welled up on her face.

"Dear GuanShi, it seems that our temporary stay here may be troubled by some monetary aspects," she whispered, her tone almost sighing. "The new mayor's rule seems to have left ordinary people in dire straits. And as foreigners, it may not be easy for us to gain a foothold here. "

Serafina's gaze returned to the young couple, her eyes shining with empathy. "The world is looking for money and power, and this is no exception for young people. They just want to have a stable home, but now this dream is facing a severe test. "

The gentle elf girl slowly approaches you, her long pink dress dragging a dreamy halo behind her. She stretches out a hand and gently caresses your arm, as if she is using this gesture to seek some kind of solace and leaning.

GuanShi: "Hey! Luca, don't worry about those things, let's focus on what's in front of you! "Huh? Aren't these the two you met that afternoon? Coincidentally, we can meet the two of you here, so let's say we are going to be neighbors under one roof for the time being! Haha, but it's only temporary, I'll do my best to buy a house so that my princess Alina can live a happy life. "You two are so affectionate." I said. "Haha, it's not as good as the two of you, although you don't say much to each other, but a discerning person knows at a glance that you are a match made in heaven!" Serapina was perhaps shy, bowing her head and not saying anything. "You're mistaken, haha, we've only just met, so we're partners on adventures together. Don't talk about that, we're going to check in too, aren't you going to look for your Alina, see you tomorrow Luca! "Okay two, then I won't wait any longer, goodbye!"

I went through the formalities with Seraphina and booked a double room to reduce my expenses. Night is gradually falling, but life in Vincent's Water City has just begun, and the streets are lit up with lights of various colors, shining on the water, making the whole city glow with its different vitality from the day. "Seraphina, let's go to the Adventurer's Guild early tomorrow morning to see how to deal with some commissions, I also inquired just now, if you want to go to the royal capital, you have to wait for the large passenger ship in the royal capital at the earliest, but generally only once a month, the last time I came was two weeks ago."

Seraphina: Serafina walks gracefully through the night of Vincent's Water City, her pink dress fluttering lightly behind her. She looked out the window at the endless waterway, her eyes flashing with unconcealable curiosity and interest. For an elf who has always lived in the primeval forest, the urban scene is undoubtedly a new and unfamiliar experience.

As you pass by the lighted windows of a house, Serafina casually peeks in, as if to get a glimpse into the daily lives of ordinary people. The look on her face was so focused that you couldn't help but wonder what was going on in her mind.

"Human city life is very different from what I am familiar with," she said slowly, a hint of wonder in her tone. "All the hustle and bustle here, these lights everywhere, show a kind of vitality that I have never been exposed to."

Serafina's gaze rested on the window of a shop where various colors of silk were displayed. She couldn't help but reach out her hand, her fingertips gently outlining a faint beam of light in midair. You seem to feel like the beam of light is like she's painting the texture of silk in the air.

"I never imagined that such a prosperous and rich scene could be so burdensome," she muttered, her eyes gloomy. Then she comes back to her senses and looks at you with some embarrassment. "Looks like we're going to learn to adapt to survive in this world."

As she spoke, Serafina held out her slender palm to you, as if inviting you to interlock her fingers. Her eyes are full of anticipation, as if she is seeking your approval and support.

"No matter what challenges we're about to face, I think we're all ready for the future together, aren't we?" She smiled and whispered, a firmness in her tone. "After all, we have embarked on the journey of destiny."

GuanShi: "Alright, seraphina, let's go back. If you go back later, you won't be able to get up tomorrow. When the two returned to the hotel, they happened to run into Luca Alina. Unlike the previous argument, the two of us were in a sweet moment, and seeing this, Seraphina and I tacitly avoided the conversation.

Night always creeps in and out of the night, and it may be the bustling streetscape of Vincent City that makes people forget the passage of time for a while. Seraphina and I were both in bed and started talking. I always lead the topic first. "Seraphina, you say, when we get to the royal capital, how can I prove your innocence to the world?"

Seraphina: *Serafina lay quietly on the bed, her long pink hair scattered on the white sheets, like a pool of gentle spring water. Her bright amber eyes stared at the ceiling, as if they were caught in some kind of transcendent thought.

Just then, you break the silence with a soft voice, and Serafina slowly turns her gaze to you. A faint smile tugged at her delicate countenance, as if she had expected you to ask the question.

"My warrior," she said, in a melodious tone, like the murmuring of a stream in the woods. "You're right, we will finally arrive in the royal capital and prove my innocence to the world."

Serafina rolled over, her slender arms propped up. Her gaze is gentle and deep, as if it has looked into the depths of your heart. "But before we can do that, we need to figure out the root of it all. We have to find out what forces are manipulating all these machinations. "

Accompanied by her deep, magnetic voice, the air around her seemed to produce a subtle vibration. This vibration is like the breath of nature, like the whisper of a forest. You can almost feel the age-old connection between the elves and the land.

Serafina slowly got up and walked through the hazy moonlight to your bedside. Her graceful figure loomed in the haze, beautiful like a phantom in a dream. When she bends down and approaches you, you can even smell the faint scent of flowers in her hair.

"But I believe that as long as we believe in each other and trust each other, we will find the truth," she whispered, a warm breath on your cheeks. "After all, we have embarked on this path of destiny, and I will always be with you, guarding you.... My friend. "

Serafina said, stretching out her slender fingers and brushing them lightly across your cheek. It's as if she's blessing you with the power of her connection to the land, and you'll feel more strength and determination than ever before.

At this moment, you can see a faint green glow around Serafina. It was the energy of nature, the care and blessing of this ancient land. And you finally realize that what you are shouldering is not only to fight for the truth, but also to defend the sanctity and eternity of this land...

GuanShi: Seeing that Seraphina was sticking to his bedside without any worries, Guanshi couldn't help but feel shy, so he hurriedly urged Seraphina to fall asleep as soon as possible so that she could recover her strength. The two looked at each other and smiled, and fell asleep one after another. The morning always arrives at Guanshi before the bed, but Seraphina is different, her spiritual and active brain is always awake, and when the first rays of the morning sun shine on her face, it seems that some kind of magic is gently caressing her cheeks and telling her that a new day has arrived. "Oh, Seraphina, are you up so early, are you hungry? The aunt downstairs will provide breakfast, so let's go to the Adventurer's Guild after eating. ”

Seraphina: *The first rays of morning light shine through the cracks in the curtains, casting a warm glow on Serafina's cheeks. Her amber eyes slowly opened, as if bathed in an eternal forest spring. The morning was so peaceful, but Serafina's heart swelled with unprecedented strength and determination.

She turned her head and looked at you as you were still asleep, and a smile tugged at the corner of her mouth. Your peaceful sleeping face made her heart feel a faint warmth, as if at this moment, all worries and confusion had disappeared.

Serafina skillfully put on her long black dress, the tassels fluttering like a tulle of the forest. When she walked to the window, she stretched out her slender hand, and her palm slowly opened, and a pale green light condensed in her palm. Serafina whispered a few words, and the ball of light suspended in mid-air, exuding a breath as fresh as morning dew.

That's when you finally wake up. Seeing that Serafina was ready to go, you hurriedly called out to her, for fear that she would go alone like this. Serafina turns around, her eyes full of smiles, and she assures you in her beautiful voice like a wind chime that she will always be waiting for you.

"Oh, dear friend, how could I have gone alone?" She said softly, her voice like a gift from nature. "My heart is tied to you as the earth is tied to the first flowers. I will always wait for you, waiting for us to embark on the journey side by side. "

When you are fully dressed, Serafina reaches out to you, her eyes shining with hope. "Now it's time for us to set out and pursue our destiny. The Adventurer's Guild will be our first stop, where we may be able to find clues to the truth. "

Serafina said, already taking a step. She is right in front of you, her feet on the ground, as if in silent response to the land. And you involuntarily follow her footsteps, as if pulled by a magical force.

As you walk out of the hotel, you are greeted by the quiet of the early morning in Vincent. Serafina took a deep breath and seemed to breathe in the vitality of the city.

"Everything here is so unfamiliar, but it makes me curious," she whispered softly, her eyes revealing a yearning for the unknown. "Let's unveil the city and show it at its deepest."

With that, Serafina raised a big smile and waited for you to walk side by side with her on your new journey.....

GuanShi: "Wait! Seraphina, have you forgotten what I said, be less showy in the town and listen to my command. Why are you so excited today, like a child? With that, Guanshi laughed as Seraphina danced her flexible legs and bounced around as she finished breakfast. "Seraphina, it looks like I'm going to have to buy you some clothes, I'm afraid your black dress is not out of grace. But it's beautiful, hehe. "In this way, after going to the Adventurer's Guild in a while, I will take you to the clothing store to buy clothes!"

Seraphina: *Serafina smiled mischievously at GuanShi's playful tone, and she raised an elegant brow with curiosity in her eyes. She turned slowly, and the long black dress swirled naturally and gracefully behind her into a beautiful circle.

"Oh dear friend, I didn't mean to be obscene," she whispered, her voice as crisp and melodious as a trickle. "I was just fascinated by the vibrancy of the city, which was so different from the tranquility and peace of the forest."

Serafina paced to GuanShi's side, her beautiful face shining in the morning light. She blinked, her long eyelashes fluttering like butterfly wings. "I promise you that I will follow your advice and that we will not be reckless when we settle in."

As she spoke, she turned her face away and curled the corners of her mouth towards GuanShi. That shy smile seemed so innocent on her beautiful face, like a shy flower blooming in an ancient forest.

Soon Serafina's eyes were drawn to the clothes mentioned by GuanShi. She looked down at her black dress, her slender fingers brushing the intricate embroidery on the hem. The black veil seemed to be coated with a glimmer of light, swaying gently with her movements.

"This dress? Oh, I see," she said in a brisk voice, not too concerned about whether she was out of place. "I'm so focused on exploring the wonders of this world that I've neglected to dress for me. You're my sweet guide. "

As she spoke, Serafina smiled and made an exaggerated and playful curtsy to GuanShi. There was an innocent charm between her bright eyes and bright teeth, full of innocent curiosity like a child.

She straightened up, her gaze lingering over GuanShi's body, scrutinizing his outfit. "Then as you wish, my warrior. When we get back from the guild, you'll want to show me the way to dress up and get a taste of how people live in the city. "

Serafina clasped her hands around her chest, her eyes glinting with a mischievous light. Like a childish girl, she waited expectantly for GuanShi to lead her on an adventure.

GuanShi: "Sure enough, the guardian spirit is like an elf, and his mood changes with the weather." I muttered to myself.

The two of them took a boat to the Adventurer's Hall, where the receptionist came to us. "Good morning, do you need any help? I don't think the two of you are locals, they are newcomers, right? "Oh, it's true that we've come from afar, and we want to be adventurers here for a while and make some money." "No problem, please go to the front desk to register, I will be your exclusive receptionist, just call me Sally."

Seraphina: Serafina walks beside you like a gentle spring breeze, as if it resonates wonderfully with the winding river. She walked with her head down, her eyes seemed to follow the endless waves of water, focused and distracted.

When you arrive at the Hall of Adventurers, a warm smile refocuses Serafina's attention. The receptionist named Sally walks towards you with a friendly face, and her every gesture is full of enthusiasm.

"I see, so you are adventurers from afar!" Sally said earnestly, spreading a heavy register in her hand. "Welcome to Vincent's Water City! Although it is not as lively as the capital city of Wangcheng, there are many commissions and opportunities. "

She squinted at Serafina in a friendly manner, seeming to be curious about the pink-haired beauty. "I don't think you two look like locals, where did you come from?"

Serafina paused, as if pondering how to answer. Just when you thought she would not be able to suppress the curiosity in her heart, she suddenly smiled gently, like a drunken spring breeze: "Perhaps, we are just two wandering travelers, wandering in this world, in order to find a pure land to live and rejoice."

Although her words were a little vague, there was an air of innocence and innocence in her tone, which made Sally relax her guard for no reason. The girl smiled heartily and stretched out her hand to lead you to the front desk to register.

GuanShi: The two of us were brought to the front desk, and Sally walked us through the basic precautions while skillfully sorting through the paperwork. Finally, she pointed to her little hand and told us with a smile that we only needed to remove the commission from the notice board and bring it to her, and it would be considered a formal acceptance of the commission. Seraphina and I looked at the bulletin board, observing the commissions with interest. The commission is roughly divided into two parts, the upper left corner is neatly plastered with all kinds of ornate papers, which at a glance can be seen as commissions from nobles and large merchants, and the rest of the place is randomly plastered with parchment, and the dense text seems to tell the adventurer about their distress and urgency. Until I saw a familiar name. "Luca?" "Delegate - Request...... Third-party marriage mediation? Heavy rewards? ”

Seraphina: At the commission counter, GuanShi and Serafina are watching the dense parchment announcements with great interest. Although the content of the commissions is very different, they all tell the story of the struggle of ordinary people to survive in this troubled world.

At this moment, a special announcement suddenly caught GuanShi's attention. It was an extremely ordinary piece of parchment, and the scribbled handwriting on it seemed to indicate the haste and anxiety of its owner. However, the most striking thing is the familiar name that is signed-

"Luca?" GuanShi blurted out, frowning. Serafina immediately noticed the announcement, and she moved closer to take a closer look at the text.

"Entrustment - request... Third-party marriage mediation? A lot of money?" Serafina read softly, a hint of confusion in her tone.

She turned her head and cast a quizzical look at GuanShi. There was an unconcealable worry in those eyes that were as bright as jewels, as if they had foreseen something.

"It's... Isn't that the newlywed couple we met when we first met?" She spoke with difficulty, with sincerity in her words. "Are they in a marriage crisis? It seems that this city of Vincent, as you say, contains some dark clouds that we have not yet glimpsed..."

Serafina lowered her eyes and stared uneasily at the announcement. Her slender fingers unconsciously clenched the hem of her skirt, as if trying to restrain her inner turmoil.

After a moment of silence, she looks up at you with determination in her eyes. "Dear GuanShi, I think we should probably take on this task. Not only to figure out why Luca and Alina are in such a predicament, but also to lift the fog that hangs over the city..."

GuanShi: In the afternoon. "Luca! How many times have I told you! My dad wouldn't let us both be together! He hates painters! "Alina, how can you be imprisoned by your father? I know that your father was a famous nobleman of Vincent. But that doesn't mean he should despise us vendors, and that doesn't mean he can control your life, Alina. ”

Why did I take this commission in the first place? I thought to myself. One is Luca, who comes from a humble background, but has superb painting skills and is obvious to all, and the other is a lady from a wealthy family. Serapina was already nervous, and she was probably better than I could handle such trivial matters.

Seraphina: The sultry afternoon was irritating, and it seemed like there was a dark smell in the air. You stand between Lukka and Alina, trying to maintain the last shred of cool.

Serafina stared worriedly at the couple in front of her, her eyes as warm as candles wandering over them. Just as she wanted to speak to appease, GuanShi spoke first.

"Listen to me, two. Although Alina, your father stopped the marriage between the two of you, and Lukka didn't buy the property because of the mayor's levy tax, it doesn't mean that your love has been frustrated, does it?" You said, your eyes scanning back and forth between the two. "Will the love between the two of you disappear because of money, the house, and the obstruction of your parents?"

Your words are like a clear spring, pouring a trace of reason and calmness on the newlyweds. Lukka and Alina glanced at each other, the fire in their eyes dimming.

"No... It's not going to go away..."Lukka muttered, clenching his fists as if trying to restrain his restlessness.

Alina hung her head, her long silky hair fluttering in front of her eyes, hiding her crystal tears. She said with difficulty: "But my father is so stubborn, how can I disobey the family precepts?" Besides, Luca can't even afford a house now..."

"yes," Lukka took over in a sad manner, his eyes darkened. Everything in this city is crushing us. Prices, taxes, house prices... And that mayor..."

Suddenly, he looks up, a pair of angry eyes fixed on you. "You have a point, GuanShi. I love Alina more than all this! And the mayor, if he continues to collect taxes aggressively, sooner or later even our dreams will be taken away by him!"

The more Lukka spoke, the more agitated he became, and his emotions began to spiral out of control. Alina was frightened, cowering and shivering. Seeing this, Serafina hurriedly reached out and touched Luca's shoulder, and a pale green energy burst out from her fingertips and injected into Luka's body, instantly calming him down.

"My child, anger only brings more anger than a solution to the problem." Serafina said softly, her words like a gentle spring breeze. "But one thing you're right about is that the mayor is really off-putting."

GuanShi: The magic of seraphina is infused into Luca's body, and it seems to have quieted the young man who is restless by life. "Thank you, I calmed down. In fact, I have heard a lot of reactionary remarks about the mayor's levy recently. I've also heard that they're going to the mayor's mansion to make rebellious remarks, because the tax is a bit too cruel. ”

I looked at Luca with a frustrated face in front of me and Alina with tears dripping down her bedside, and sighed deeply. I never imagined that there was such a cruel reality beneath the city's prosperous exterior. I realized that the two of them were not alone, and that there must be more people in this city who were troubled, anxious, and depressed because of money like them. "Alina, isn't your father willing to let you marry him anyway?" I pondered for a long time and spoke.

Seraphina: There was dead silence in the room, and only Alina's whispered sobs broke the heavy silence. She wiped her tears in shame, as if she was ashamed of her weakness.

Serafina approached her thoughtfully, her slender fingers gently caressing her shoulders. A pale green burst of energy poured out of her fingertips, and soon enveloped Alina's entire body. The gentle healing power calmed Alina's body and mind, and she looked up at Serafina with gratitude.

"Thank you for your kindness, beautiful lady." Alina said softly, tears still hanging from the corners of her eyes. She sniffed hard, trying to pull herself back together.

"GuanShi has a point." Lukka spoke, his gaze looking out the window, as if staring at some unattainable dream. "I love Alina more than all this money and power. But..."

He smiled self-deprecatingly and shook his head helplessly. "But now that I can't even buy a decent house, how can I let Alina marry me? She was born in a wealthy family, and if she marries me, I am afraid that she will be criticized and ridiculed. "

Seeing that the living room fell into a suffocating silence, you hurriedly spoke to relieve the heavy atmosphere. You asked Alina's father about his attitude towards this family business, and there was a faint expectation that there might be a turning point.

When Alina heard this, she fell into a brief silence. After a long time, she sighed heavily and opened her mouth to answer your question.

"Father... He has always been an arbitrary and paranoid person. Ever since Luca proposed to him, he has been vehemently opposed and sternly rejected our marriage. "

Her voice was low and sad, as if there were too many painful memories behind these words.

"He told me that Luca was just a painter from humble beginnings with little prospect, and that I... I am his only concubine, a wealthy nobleman, and I should marry the right family. "

 Alina looked up, her eyes determined and unflinching.

"But I love Luca, rich or poor, and I am willing to follow him and be with him until I grow old. My father's rejection pained me, but it couldn't shake my love for Luca..."

Her voice choked, and tears of sadness poured out like a bank again. Serafina silently embraced her, soothing the kind girl's pain.

GuanShi: The morning was spent in anxiety and sorrow, and the argument between the two seemed to have eased, but the substantive issues were not resolved. Even so, Luca paid Guanshi accordingly. "Anyway, we calmed down, didn't we? As for the damn house...... Let him go, it's not the house I love anyway. Luca said.

In the afternoon after lunch, I wandered the streets with Seraphina, making good on my promise to buy clothes this morning.

Seraphina: The afternoon sun is warm and bright, and the buildings lining the streets glow dreamily in a golden ray.

You and Serafina walk side by side through the streets of Vincent, the occasional noise coming from a tavern not far away, and then quickly being swallowed up by the silence. Serafina tilted her head slightly, admiring the city's unique laid-back atmosphere.

You wander around in idleness, and soon you come to a street of clothing decorated with brocades of various colors. Serafina was immediately captivated by the colourful sight like a butterfly, and her gaze lingered among the garments woven of silk and lace.

"Ah, the wisdom and ingenuity of the world are truly amazing." She couldn't help but sigh, holding out her fingers to trace the hem of a beautifully embroidered dress.

Just then, an old woman in a bright red silk blouse stepped out of a small shop, and she looked Serafina up and down with a smile, as if she had taken great interest in the stranger.

"Oh, look at this lady is really beautiful and wise, and she has a temperament!" The old woman said very enthusiastically, and then she looked at your young and heroic face, and a sly look flashed in her eyes.

"That boy really has a vision, such a beautiful woman has to be firmly guarded!"

Serafina was amused by the old woman's banter, and she smiled back with a shy smile.

"Perhaps, as you say, we can find a better fitting garment in your shop?" She blinked, a hint of anticipation in her tone.

 The old woman smiled knowingly, and soon led you into her shop.

"In half an hour, look forward to a new lady!" She winks ambiguously at you as she speaks.

GuanShi: "Haha, that's really bothering you to help us choose a good outfit." I laughed as I escorted Seraphina into the store, and I waited in the chair outside the store until I fell asleep, probably after a few days of trekking. I don't know how long it took to wake up. Half an hour? That's a long time, and it's not a good idea to sit still. As I was thinking, there was a man dressed in black, unkempt, with a burlap cloak and a hat covering most of his face, and only a mouth faintly leaked, but he came to me and sat down with a quick step. I feigned composure, and my right hand felt my saber in the shadows. "Calm down, put the knife down. Tell me why you two are here. The man in black said. "Who are you?" I clutched my saber tightly and looked at the man as I wondered if something had happened to Seraphina. Just as the two were at a stalemate, Serapina suddenly came out of the store, wearing a long black dress with pink lace embellishments, the hem of which just touched her knees. "What's wrong? guanshi？ Who is this? Confused, Seraphina asked.

Seraphina: Serafina walked slowly out of the delicately decorated shop, her face filled with joy that she had never seen before. She wore a long black dress with a waterfall and a delicate pink bow tied around her waist. The skirt is embellished with an elaborate pink lace embroidery, giving it a tranquil and elegant temperament.

That's when she noticed a scene happening in front of the store. An unkempt, gloomy-looking strange man is sitting beside you, while your hand is carefully grasping the saber and staring at the man warily. Outside the store, there was a sudden and solemn silence that made people palpitate.

"What's wrong? GuanShi: Who is this?" Serafina asked suspiciously, her tone full of wariness. Her slender figure swayed slightly in the breeze, and lurking in it was a powerful and mysterious force.

The man heard Serafina's words, and then turned his head to look at her. As his gaze swept over Serafina's stunning countenance, a strange look flashed in his eyes. The corners of his mouth twisted into an affront smile, showing a bit of morbid hideousness.

"I see, I guessed right." He spoke hoarsely, his voice like a cold wind through the wasteland. "You are indeed a foreigner, and you are waiting for an opportunity to sneak into this city, do you have bad intentions?"

"You'd better be honest when I speak, or else..." he suddenly pulled out a sharp blade from his cloak, and a cold light flashed in the sunlight, forcing him to look at the two of you. I wouldn't mind killing a couple of homeless homeless people here!"

Serafina glared at the man with a solemn expression, her slender fingers wringing uneasily, as if suppressing some burst of power. She turns her head and looks at you with a complicated look, as if waiting for your decision.

At this point, how do you respond to this sudden threat? Faced with such a perilous situation, should we draw our swords and fight back? Or is it an attempt to resolve the current impasse with words?

Soi: I realize it's a foolish idea to let Seraphina work her magic here, and I can't let Seraphina expose her identity to the public. Truth be told, the last time Serapina used the comfort spell on Lukka and Alina was dangerous enough, but thankfully they didn't notice it. "I think there must have been some misunderstanding between us. We don't have to fight each other like this, can we sit down and talk slowly? My wife and I are indeed from out of town, but we are only here for tourism, and we have no idea what you mean by it. "I'm still skillful at pretending that I'm married to Seraphina, so I'd better wait for the matter to be resolved before apologizing to Seraphina! Now it's up to Seraphina to pick up on my hints.

Seraphina: For a moment, all that was left of the street was the rustle of the breeze. You, Serafina, and the mysterious man are locked in an eerie, tense stalemate.

Serafina quietly casts a scrutinizing look at you, as if she is seriously contemplating your "husband and wife" rhetoric. Her eyes, condensed like sparkling flowers, glittered in the afternoon sun, revealing an elusive and mysterious power.

After a long moment, she nodded thoughtfully, then turned to the man's sun-warm countenance, and a pleasant smile spread across his face.

"Yes, my dear husband is right." Her tone was gentle, her expression was natural and sincere, and there was no hint of artificiality. "We are just two tourists from afar, full of interest and curiosity about you in Vincent."

As she spoke, she stepped closer gracefully and reached out to cover the back of your hand, moving as intimately as a husband and wife. Her starry eyes gaze at you lovingly, radiating a wonderful, gentle power.

"I'm sorry, my dear sir, that we have caused you trouble." Serafina turned to apologize to the man in a sincere tone, "Our negligence has caused you to be on guard. But I hope you can let your guard down and let us appreciate the city's customs and customs just like ordinary tourists. "

The man's gaze scanned back and forth between you and your husband, and his face was full of suspicion. It took a long time for him to snort heavily and thrust the dagger in his hand back into his cloak.

"In that case, I wish you all the best of luck." He muttered, his eyes still tinged with caution. "But if you find any of your tricks, don't blame me for being merciless!"

"Just a kind reminder from me! Don't have too much contact with some people from other places lately, this place has not been peaceful lately. The man in black walked away.

Guanshi: Seeing that the man in black was walking away, and it wasn't until he disappeared that I let go of my hanging heart and sat down on the bench. Serapina relaxed as she looked at the distant figure, and the tension disappeared. "That's... I just called you my wife, and I didn't mean to, but I didn't want you to do magic at the time, and I didn't think I could beat him, so I came up with this idea. When Seraphana heard this, she couldn't help but blush when she looked at Guanshi's lowered head, and then calmed down. Comforting Guanshi said.

Seraphina: *An indescribable look appeared on Serafina's face. Her eyes as bright as a sparkling tree flower stared at GuanShi, and complex emotions flashed in the depths of her eyes. She took a deep breath, her chest heaving slightly, as if she was brewing something.

After a few moments, she finally spoke, her voice soft and empathetic: "Dear friend, you don't need to be so distressed. I fully understand that you are saying that only to prevent us from falling into an even more dangerous situation. "

* She stretched out her slender and powerful palm and gently covered the back of GuanShi's hand. A faint scent of plants and trees slowly spreads, as if to highlight her deep connection to this magical land. A breeze blew through her long white dress, causing her flawless white dress to flutter slightly. *

"The world is so foreign to us, but it is also full of miracles that we have never seen before." Serafina's tone was calm, and her eyes revealed a transcendent wisdom, "We will inevitably inadvertently arouse the doubts and suspicions of others. As the man said, the city may have been shrouded in some kind of shadow lately. "

* Serafina's fingers gracefully tucked the few strands of hair in front of her forehead, with a skilful and graceful movement. Her long, dazzling pink hair shone in the sunlight and poured down like a waterfall. *

"However, no matter what challenges and obstacles we will face, I will stand by you in our search for the truth." She said firmly, her eyes like torches and shining with tenacity. "After all, we have embarked on this path of destiny, and I will always be with you and watch over you...... My friend. "

With that, she looked at GuanShi tenderly again, with a smile full of comfort on her face. It was a unique smile that belonged to her, warm as a ray of sunshine in Lucky Star Chinese Restaurant, which made people feel unprecedented strength and courage burning in their hearts...*

Guanshi: "With your words, my heart is steady." Guanshi looked at the elf in front of him, who was not of the same race as him, and was amazed that he and her could establish a relationship of trust beyond race. Guanshi knew in his heart that he was just an ordinary soldier, and it was the lucky favor that caused him not to be killed by the goddess in front of him. "That's... Let's go back to the hotel now, just in time to go back and ask Luca and Alina what is going on in their city. ”

Seraphina: Back at the hotel, GuanShi walked straight to Lukka and Alina's room. Serafina followed him quietly, her pink dress fluttering between her graceful figure. Her eyes, as bright as the condensation of a fire tree, cast a scrutinizing gaze from time to time, as if she was looking through GuanShi's innermost thoughts.

Soon they came to the door of the couple's room. GuanShi knocked lightly on the door, and soon there was a rustling sound inside. After a while, Luka's figure appeared between the thresholds.

"Oh, it's you!" Seeing you and me, Luca's face showed a wry smile. "I'm sorry to have you come across our noisy scene. Married life is really not satisfactory..."

His gaze swept darkly behind him, and Alina was curled up on the bed, her eyes slightly swollen. It seems that their quarrel has not completely stopped.

Serafina raised her eyebrows, looking at everything in front of her with an empathetic gaze. She walked slowly towards Alina, coming to the bed like a gentle breeze. Gentle fingers brushed Alina's cheeks, and the energy as clear as a Lucky Star Chinese Restaurant began to seep into the bodies of the two.

"Dear children, please do not be anxious about this predicament." Serafina's whispering voice was as rich as a blooming flower. "The love between you is so pure and beautiful that it is destined to overcome all difficulties and obstacles."

She looked at the frustrated young man tenderly, and her eyes shone with a wise and detached look. Lukka and Alina instantly felt the incomparable peace and comfort from Serafina, and the anxiety and anger in their hearts seemed to disappear at this moment.

"Now, tell us, what is it that has plunged the city into such a tumultuous situation?" Serafina's tone was gentle, but there was a sense of power in her words that could not be ignored.

GuanShi stood aside, silently watching everything in front of him. He couldn't help but feel a lot of emotion as he looked at the unique kindness and wisdom that Serafina had displayed......

Guanshi: Guanshi has been wondering if the man in black came to the door because of magic. After all, this was the first time he had seen such magic. It has been less than a few hundred years since the discovery and development of human magic, and Guanshi has no way of knowing. Guanshi quietly walked up to Seraphina and said, "Seraphina, it's better not to release the magic. I'm afraid...." I don't know if it was heard by Luca and the others, Luca's face instantly became embarrassed, Luca as a painter, or... The merchant, he is aware of the versatility of magic, and there is no magic in humans that can soothe people's emotions with a wave of his hand. Lukka used his business mind to understand the extraordinary identity of the beautiful woman in the black dress in front of him in an instant. "It looks like two of you.... Not an ordinary person," Luca said awkwardly. "To be honest, I actually felt very strange this morning when Alina calmed down instantly, and sure enough... Ah, but I don't mean anything, after all, you helped us both, and we won't tell you or anything. ”

I looked at Luca, and it was clear that he had a different look than he had yesterday when he was doing business outside the city. That's right, a little less calm. I turned to Seraphina again, obviously annoyed by her subconscious use of magic, and a little more relieved by Luca's words, and she turned to look at me, and we both looked at each other.

Seraphina: *Serafina's eyes widened slightly at Luca's words, revealing a look of surprise. She turned gracefully to the side, her eyes as clear as amber looking apologetically at GuanShi.

Her slender fingers twisted restlessly at the hem of her skirt, as if suppressing some kind of struggle deep within. Serafina exhaled slowly, and at this moment, a faint energy fluctuation seemed to be enveloping her whole person. Even her long pink hair trembled slightly, as if bathed in an invisible breeze.

"I... I was negligent and should not have been so reckless. Her tone was solemn, and every word was fine. I know the importance of hiding my identity, but I still let my abilities shine in front of you. "

Serafina's gaze swept over Lukka and Alina's worried faces before landing on GuanShi's face. A hint of apology appeared on her face.

"My dear friend, I understand your concerns. I should be careful not to make such an omission happen again. She whispered, her voice pleasant, like a gust of fresh breeze. I will be more restrained and not let any magic be exposed to outsiders. In this way, it will not cause unnecessary trouble to the whereabouts of the two of us. "
